*Note : Not specially a study plan, just an organized list of what I whant to learn and how, eventually when, etc...*


# Languages

I want to know multiple languages. It is more important for me to have a broad understanding of concepts, and find languages that I really enjoy using, rather than being a XXX programmer. Not sure how much that makes sense in a career, since most companies seem to be looking for a 'Java Engineer'.

Above all it is very important to learn different paradigms, and languages that are very different.

## C++

It has been my main language for a while, the first one I really know, after my school stopped teaching us Ada. I enjoy successfully finishing something in C++, but it is really tiring, and everything seems harder than it seems. It's still a powerful and useful language, popular in some areas I am interested in../
So I am not sure yet how much should I study it.

Current Idea about that :

I keep my current knowledge, and I try to actually study advanced C++ concepts. I don't specially do it *gor  C++* and don't *need* to be experienced using these things, but I want to know about it.
Indeed C++ abilities in Metaprogramming, Generic programmic and others, its multiparadigm essence make it in my opinion a good medium to learn about many concepts while keeping it centered around something I know.
I also want to truly understand the core concepts of C++ (RAII, etc...)

In this aspect, in seems important that I follow and learn about the 'modern' evolution of the language (11,14,17).

Boost is huge, and not specially necessary unless I want strong 'emplayable' skills for C++ dev, but it has many very interesting parts that are worth studying as well.

### What ?

I don't want to be a C++ developper (i.e don't need to know everything about shipping/maintaining/ C++ projects ) but I want to keep it such that I can use it as my main language.
More than that, I want to have strong purely technical abilities, and understanding about C++.

It's a language I'll probably have on my resume, so I should assume that.

### How?

I could eventually have some projects in C++, if I find any utility. If I want something performant, I could prototype it in Python, and then reimplement it in C++.

But I think I mostly need to study from **books**

## Java

To be honest, I dont' specially like programming in Java, despite its many advantages on C++. So there is no reason to make it one of my important languages. But Java is very important for many reasons :
* I use it at work, so I should know enough to do good work
* Its concept and the JVM are important in the SE world
* Many SE and especially Design Pattern classes and tutorial are based on Java

So in my opinion I should learn :
* Enough understanding to use it for work or courses
* Understand the core concepts, what do they mean, the objective reasons to chose for or against it (even though I don't like it so much)

### How ?

Through books talking about programming language, and tutorial/research when I come across something I need to do or want to understand.

## Python

It seems like it is more and more my 'main language'. I really enjoy the comfortable syntax, and the community is really great in my opinion, as is the libraries ecosystem.

As a result, I should study hard all the important concepts and details about Python. I want to really know what I am doing.

More importantly, I should know about libraries and study them as well, since it is in my opinion the strength of Python.
Important libraries : Flask, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, numpy, sklearn, TensorFlow, nltk, etc...


So it's quite clear, I want to be both very able to use it and very interviewable about it.

### How ?

Anything that works is very wellcomed here :

* Books, MOOC and tutorials
* Do many different projects (Data Science, Web, Games, Scripts, prototyping anything) that make me learn things

## JavaScript

Javascript has many defaults, but it has many advantages that make me want to learn it as well :

* Concurrency is very important in JS, so it would give me another view of that
* it has strong capabilities
* It is very popular, and not dying soon at all (in the small category with C and Java imo)
* It is the base of the web, and web is a plaform of choice for building interface to projects.

### How ?

I don't plan to be a JS dev or webdev, so no need to read books or take classes to teach me everything about the inside of JS.

Tutorials and Projects !

## Functional Programming

I really don't know much about FP in general, so it's here like that. Indeed, for the moment the precise language doesn't matter, I just want to learn FP.

It seems like a good strategy for learning FP that would suit my abilities and tastes is : learn first **Clojure** and then **Haskell**

Clojure provides a good introduction, and Haskell is real pure FP. They are quite different inside the FP spectrum too, so it is a useful variety.  I plan to study haskell harder, but we'll see what I  like/

## Others : Open Mindedness 

It's already a lot of languages, and I've already been told it's stupid not to concentrate my efforts on one language. But to be honest, I just like it, just like languages in real world.

There is still two kind of language that I should quickly learn or read about. The 'niche' languages that have very specific uses, and the 'new' languages

### Niche

Here are the languages that have specific use cases, and very specific concepts as well. There are useful for open mindedness, and might sometimes be the best tool for a specific project!

* R, Matlab
* Prolog
* Erlang, Lisp, Perl

### New

I think it is important to follow the trends. Know the concepts people are trying to put in recent languages is the best way to know about the main challenges in the world of CS.
There are quite a few languages came out recently, and I should take a good look at some of them. And if I specially like one (I think Go could be that for example), I should study it seriously (kind of a bet on the future though)

* D : Seems like the *natural* evolution of C in modern world. Shouldn't be overlooked!
* Rust : Lots of complex features, so it is a good place to learn about many concepts. Created by Mozilla, and very very recent.
* Go : Seems halfway between Python and C++. It is written to be clear and simple, and very fast. Could be a good 'quick' learn ? Use cases are quite limited, mostly servers apparently.
* Dart : The other Google created language. It compiles to JS for writing client side code. Could use it to replace Javascript for some projects.


# Sofware Engineering

I want to be a good, able Software Engineer, more than a fast and reliable dev. 
There are many many things to learn for that, and being in a small company without experienced mentor makes it hard to learn it. But it does make me experience the failures and force me to do lots of personal research.

## Languages

Learn about the 'inside' of programming languages. It is important to understand CS core concepts, and for 'chosing the right tool'/

* Understand the different paradigms and features
* Know how to 'design' a language
* Understand how to know which language are best for which kind of tasks

### How

* MOOC and Books are obviously the main source of knowledge.
* Learning languages is useful as well.

## Design, Architecture

### Design Patterns

Learning Design Patterns is essential if I want to be able to create quality software!
Design Patterns are not only patterns that help to read and create code, but also good learning of 'why this kind of design is good', just like reading experts' code.

I want to study, understand many patterns, know how to chose one, and I need to remember the important ones.

#### How

* MOOC and Books
* Apply them in projects, at home and work

## Software Processes

This is a collection of many techniques and knowldge that are necessary to deliver 'professional' product, and handle projects.

It is very important in my work life, and my current office don't provide me the knowledge!

* Know how to handle Requirements, Specs
* Validation process (testing!)
* Code Quality process (conventions, etc...)
* Know about Software metrics and evaluation
* Understand how `integratrion` and `deployment` work
* Know the principal methodologies for Software Project Management
* Learn about MAnagement in general (Project management, Product management, etc...)

Globally, know as much as possible to everything that is used to handle project in a professional environment

### How ?

By personal research and experience
MOOC
