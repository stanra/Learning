# Learning

Personal wiki to plan my learning of Computer Science, keep and organize my knowledge.

The Wiki is kind of Meta -> put how to handle this 'wiki' . The knowledge itself should be in Markdown, with eventually some example code, pictures etc...
(A cool project would be to create a kind of real static wiki website based on these documents (and host it on GitHub)
